For my project I had created a representation of how wind pressure looks like through an amplitude wave.
To start I had set an array of locations that will display on the screen with the correct wind pressure,
after that i had gathered an API key from a trusted weather website. I had linked the API key to the pressure
data to display what would it be in that location. For the Wave effect I had collected the code from the P5.org website
as this was the most suitable representation of how I could visualise what it would like and link it to the values of the data.
After putting everything together I had made a styles sheet to bring the display of the website to a much more pleasing appeal.
To run the data you have to press the refresh button as it'll change the location.
